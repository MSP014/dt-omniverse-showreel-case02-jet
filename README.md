## 📋 Project Overview

This repository showcases a prototype **Aerospace Propulsion Digital Twin (Level L1)** demonstrating visualisation of internal processes within complex mechanical systems. The case study centres on a jet engine mounted on a test stand, presented in cross-section to reveal thermodynamic and mechanical phenomena in real-time.

**Key Use Case:**
The digital twin integrates **pre-simulated Houdini caches for each operational regime** (Idle, Takeoff, Cruise, Maximum Thrust). These simulation states are seamlessly switched within Omniverse based on engine mode, visualising temperature distribution, combustion dynamics, and mechanical stresses. This exemplifies how L1 Digital Twins enable sophisticated engineering data visualisation without requiring real-time physics computation.

**Project Focus:**

- **Complex Assembly Management:** Handling 10,000+ parts using USD Variants and Payloads
- **Simulation Pipeline:** Houdini Pyro/Fluid simulations optimised into lightweight USD caches
- **Data-Driven Visualisation:** Python-based sensor streams (RPM, EGT, Vibration) synchronised with visual states

---

## 🎯 Key Technical Workflows

- **Optimized USD Pipelines:** Processing heavy Houdini Pyro/Fluid simulations into lightweight USD payloads for real-time Omniverse playback.
- **Data-Driven Digital Twin:** Python-based generation of realistic sensor streams (RPM, EGT, Vibration) linked to flight regimes (Idle, Takeoff, Cruise).
- **Complex Assembly Management:** Leveraging USD Variants and Payloads to structure massive mechanical assemblies (10k+ parts).

## 💾 Project Data / Assets

### 🏭 The "Factory" Narrative
>
> This repository follows a strict **"Source vs. Artifact"** philosophy:
>
> - **Houdini (Fabricator):** The procedural "factory" where assets are generated. Source files (`.hip`) are proprietary and **excluded** from this repository.
> - **USD (Artifact):** The "product" of the factory. These are the optimized files needed to run the Digital Twin in Omniverse.
> - **Synthetic Data:** Telemetry streams are emulated via Python generators to simulate robust edge cases (e.g., extreme thermal loads) that are rarely captured in real-world data.

### 📦 Asset Hydration

To keep this repository lightweight, heavy binary assets (USD Crates, Textures, HDRIs) are stored externally.

- [**Download Asset Pack (One Drive / S3 Link TBD)**](https://example.com/placeholder)

**Hydration Steps:**

1. Download the ZIP archive from the link above.
2. **Extract contents** directly into the `assets/_external/` folder.
    - *Note: This folder already exists (anchored by `.gitkeep`), so you simply unzip into it.*
    - *Result:* Your local path should look like `assets/_external/usd/my_asset.usd`.

## 🛠️ Toolchain & Environment

**Required Software:**

- **Houdini**: 21.0.596 (for PDG/Pyro/Fluid simulations)
- **Omniverse**: 2024.x (USD scene assembly, Isaac Sim integration)
- **Isaac Sim**: 5.1 (for physics simulation and sensor emulation)
- **Python**: 3.10+ (for data generation and pipeline scripting)
- **Conda**: For environment isolation (`case02-env`)

**Install Steps:**

1. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/MSP014/dt-omniverse-showreel-case02-jet.git`
2. **Hydration:** (See "Asset Hydration" above) - Extract assets to `assets/_external/`.
3. **Env:** Create conda env: `conda create -n case02-env python=3.10`
4. **Deps:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Hooks:** `pre-commit install`
