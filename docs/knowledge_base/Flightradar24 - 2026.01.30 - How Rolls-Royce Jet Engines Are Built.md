The provided text details the operations at the Rolls-Royce facility in Derby, Northern England, specifically focusing on the engineering efforts to enhance the durability of the Trent 1000 engine used in Boeing 787 aircraft. The material outlines the technical challenges associated with the engine's high-pressure (HP) turbine system, which operates under extreme heat and stress, and describes the facility's modular maintenance processes designed to maximize "time on wing" for airline customers.

**Key Themes and Subtopics:**

* **Trent 1000 Durability Enhancements:** The primary discussion centers on addressing engine wear through a two-phase improvement plan. Phase one introduces a 40% increase in cooling airflow to the HP turbine blades to manage temperatures that exceed the metal's melting point. Phase two involves reducing the weight of the blades to lower centrifugal stress, cumulatively aimed at doubling the engine's operational lifespan between maintenance.
* **Modular Maintenance Workflow:** The text describes the specific logistical process of servicing these engines. Due to their modular design, engines are disassembled vertically to access and replace the HP "mini-module" (comprising the turbine, combustion system, and compressor) without stripping the entire engine. Following reassembly, engines undergo rigorous performance and vibration testing.
* **Advanced Inspection Technologies:** A significant portion of the text focuses on the modernization of maintenance through "Intelligent Boroscope" methods. This involves using articulating probes equipped with 3D scanners and structured light projectors to inspect internal components without disassembly.
* **Data Ecosystem and Standardization:** The discussion highlights a shift toward standardized, menu-directed inspections that generate consistent metadata. This data is integrated into cloud-based systems, facilitating remote expert analysis, AI development, and long-term fleet health monitoring.

**Key Conclusions:**

* **Engineering Solutions:** The implementation of advanced cooling techniques and lightweight materials is presented as the definitive solution for recovering fleet health and ensuring reliability for the Trent 1000.
* **Digital Integration:** The transition from manual, analog reporting to digital, cloud-connected data gathering allows for immediate global collaboration and creates a feedback loop where service data directly informs the design of future engine generations.
* **Operational Efficiency:** By standardizing inspection tools (such as automated engine turning) and repair scopes, Rolls-Royce aims to minimize turnaround times and improve the consistency of safety checks across the industry.

### Derby Site Overview and Trent 1000 Durability Enhancements

Welcome to the historical heart of Rolls-Royce engine manufacturing. We're here in Derby, Northern England, at the Rolls-Royce site, which is massive and comprised of various different facilities doing various aspects of engine maintenance, testing, final assembly, training, you name it. Here we're in the final assembly line, a global supply chain process where components come and go between sites all over the world and end up right here. This is the only place in the world where these Rolls-Royce engines do their last final assembly before they're shipped out to customers. Today we're going to be looking at various aspects of what Rolls-Royce is doing here, but especially at the Trent 1000, which is the Trent that is powering 787s, and how they've been working through the last couple of years. We're going to be looking at the Trent 1000 and how they've been working through some of the durability issues, fixing them up, getting them in and back out to customers so they can last longer for them, as well as refining the way they build these new and creating new versions that will give airlines more time on wing. And we'll get to learn about some of the really nice detailed technical aspects of what goes into that. Hopefully see some parts of engines that maybe we haven't seen before; at least I haven't. Let's go spend the day with Rolls-Royce here in Derby.

This site here goes back to 1907. That was the beginning of when this was constructed and production first started. The kind of advances over time in what they've been building here, the technology, it's just mind-boggling to think of going back to then and seeing what's happening here now. I currently lead the Trent 1000 task force who have been charged with delivering the product improvements and the fleet health recovery for the Trent 1000. We are introducing some durability enhancements onto the engine, and we're doing that in two phases. So the phase one durability enhancement introduces chiefly a 40% cooling flow improvement to our high-pressure turbine. That's the main thing. So the main thing. And it's a very good thing because the turbine blade in the hot end of the engine, what that does is essentially double the time on wing. Phase two then offers up an additional 30% time on wing through the HP turbine blade also, and that's achieved through weight reduction of the high-pressure turbine blade itself, which essentially reduces the centrifugal stresses on that blade.

### Design Characteristics of the Engine Core and Fan Case

This is a brand new, factory-fresh Trent 1000 engine headed for a 787 somewhere in the world, and you won't see an engine as clean and shiny as this. It's amazing. Another thing that's so cool to be able to see, especially well when an engine is in this state, is these modern high-bypass engines and just how small the engine core is compared to the fan diameter. You can just see straight through here, through the blades. It's so cool to see. Really cool here getting a chance to look at these parts of the engine sort of isolated, separated from each other. This is the whole section that's going to be burning fuel and creating thrust; that's your core of the engine.

Over here you have the fan case, which is not just a container for the blades, actually; it also is the brains of the whole operation. So basically over here, you can see it well, this behind me, the black thing, that's an engine control unit, and that is where all the inputs from the pilots come through to the engines. Anything they wanted to do goes through there. The fan case also, obviously very important for containing fan blades in the event of some kind of incident. You need to be able to contain these blades that are very big and spinning very fast. So they have a Kevlar-lined fan case, and the blades themselves are made of titanium, but they're actually hollow, and that's for weight saving.

### Enhancing Turbine Durability Through Advanced Cooling Techniques

This here is a very specific shop for Rolls-Royce in Derby. Here they're working on the Trent 1000s and the high-pressure turbines. The hot section of the wing is a little bit different than here from having been out on the wing flying around the world. They're getting the high-pressure turbine systems swapped out with replaced components in order to increase the durability, the time on wing as they call it. And the idea is that doing it this way, they can get them in, swapped out, fixed up, and sent back out to the airline much quicker. That's leading to a much better picture for sort of fleet reliability for the airlines that are operating the 787s with Trent 1000s.

This facility started up a year and a half ago, and they're ramping up, so they're doing more and more of this stuff around the world. The super cool thing is that what they're doing is mostly they're improving the durability of the high-pressure turbine systems by increasing the cooling airflow, drilling small holes into the hollow blades in order to keep them cooler. And this is very necessary because these things are spinning at 13,000 RPMs, they told me, over 13,000 RPMs, and they're experiencing temperatures of 1,500 degrees Celsius. Extra cool effect about that is that is 200 degrees Celsius higher than the melting point of that metal. And these things are running non-stop. Turnaround times as quick as possible; they basically never have a chance to cool down until they have a more extended maintenance check. So these things have to be incredibly durable, and they're making these improvements in durability mostly now with that increase in cooling airflow and a slightly different coating on the blades. From what they've told me, it's really stuff at the leading edge of physics, even though it seems like a minor change, and it's making a big difference to the reliability of these Trent 1000s.

### Facility Modernization and the Modular Engine Disassembly Process

This is probably the oldest building on Rolls-Royce. It actually predates Rolls-Royce on this site in Derby. This was, is, and was a very old building, but hopefully as you turn around and have a look at the reveal of what this facility looks like now, we've spent a lot of money in making this now a state... the new phase one durability modification, as we ripped up, ripped up the floor, put in new cranes, put in new gantries, brought in all new tooling, recruited over 100 people in under 12 months to bolster the workforce we've already got in Derby. We do everything in Derby from full overhauls that have to... engines have to come in on fixed intervals to have their critical parts replaced. And then we also do targeted servicing or repair if you want to go and fix a specific issue or there is a modification you want to bring into the fleet, then we have work scopes for that as well. So this shop has been set up specifically to do the work scope which is replace the existing turbine blade with the new more durable turbine blade.

A Trent engine is a modular engine. So if you want to go and get a component out of an engine, you don't have to strip the whole engine down to get the component. It is made up of modules. So when we bring these engines in, we take off the nose cone right to the front of the engine so we can then flip it over, put the engine down on its nose, and then you can start pulling the modules out of the engine. On the left, it's covered up, but the low-pressure turbine system, that's the back of the engine. So when it's on its nose at the top, you pull that out first. Then it's the IP turbine system. So just behind, you can see there's an intermediate-pressure turbine system that comes out. And then what you have exposed is the high-pressure system, which actually has the high-pressure turbine, the combustion system, and the high-pressure compression system all in a mini module. So we call that mini module. That's what this thing is here. And that is what we're going to take out of the engine to then send that to a module bay so we can do the modification in that area.

### Engine Reassembly Workflow and Performance Testing Procedures

So we'll walk down so you can see a few of these. We've actually got 15 engine bays that we've set up to do this work scope, so you'll see lots of them. We'll have a fan system and then just taken out of the top is an intercase. That is because, you'll see, we've taken out the low-pressure system, we've taken out the intermediate-pressure system, we've pulled out the HP system, and we've sent that to a module bay to have this modification done. But then as you walk down, you'll see some engines... so this engine here is actually on build. So this has had the modified HP system brought back to the engine bay. They've put that back in the engine, put the IP turbine system back on top, then the LP system back on top of that. When that has been fully dressed, we will then tip the engine back over horizontally.

We have three engine test beds in Derby that can test MRO, so Part 145, Trent 1000 aero engines. So we will send them down this gangway here. Through those doors, you can get a door that will take you all the way to one of those test beds where we will run the test, make sure meets performance requirements, vibration requirements, passes test. It will then come back to the main shop where we will dispatch it, put it in a stand, send it around the world to customer.

### Safety Protocols and High-Pressure System Reintegration

All the modules have been put back in, so they're now dressing the engine with externals, all the... all the required pipe work. You see all this tape and all these blanks? That's just... that's to stop any components from dropping down. As it is, it's a very important part of the engine, so we've got a lot of work to do. And we're either... if you're stripping an engine or building an engine, people are holding nuts and bolts in their hands. What you don't want to do is then drop it into open orifices. So that's why you see all these blanks and bits of tape to ensure that you can't get anything into the engine. So you'll see now that they would have had to have broken all these joints to be able to remove the modules. So now before we send it back to test, we're going to have to refit that, resit all these components.

What you can see here, this is the HP system, the high-pressure system. So this is the module as part of this work scope that we're wanting out of the engine to put in the new high-pressure turbine blades. And as part of this modification, there's also new fuel spray nozzles, which are... which are these components here. So on the strip, we've stripped it down. As you walked and saw the other bays, you saw just up to the intercase just sticking out from above the fan. And we will strip all these items off to get to... to get to that HP system. And because that's been modified, that has now been placed back on, then the IP turbine system, then the low-pressure turbine system, and now they're just rerouting all the pipe work and harnesses so they can send it to test. So you're not fully swapping out this whole system; you're swapping out elements of it? Yeah, correct. And we'll... we'll go to the module bay in a moment so you can see... you can see how they do that.

### Engine Induction and the Extreme Physics of Turbine Blades

You've got some inductions here. So engines we've just recently brought in. There should be a nice spinner on the front nose cone. That's obviously been taken off; otherwise, we won't be able to turn the engine on its nose. These guys, we do some induction boroscope. So we put a probe into the engine to make sure... but there's nothing else we're going to find when we open it up, so the work scope is what we want it to be. And they're just removing a level of externals in preparation for when we start stripping it vertically.

It's those modules we were pulling out the engines, so you've got different bits of the high-pressure system here. So whether it's case ears, whether it's the compressor system, those are all serviceable, waiting to be built back up into a high-pressure system. What they're waiting for us to do is, of course, replace the new HP turbine blades. It's just been fitted, so the new standard of HP turbine blades, which has been placed in a HP turbine disc, balanced assembly, and then put into the top. So over the other side, you saw this bit missing, so you could see the... the nozzle guide vanes. That's because the disc wasn't there. A balanced disc with the new blades in it has now been placed in. And these are the seal segments. The chap was just showing you that the blades run in, so you can see how it's just been dropped on top. So that's ready now to put back into the engine.

The reason why we're having to modify turbine blades, and it's so linked to time on wing... reality is this is the hardest working component in the whole of the engine. So these blades run at over 1,500 degrees centigrade and spin at over 13,000. So that's a lot of revs a minute. So you can see why under that, those extreme pressures, temperatures, speeds, that's why regularly inspect them. And if they don't meet in-service limits, you have to take the engine off. And that's often what can drive time on wing, especially with more modern fuel-efficient aero engines. So by bringing out this new standard with improved cooling, it's better coping with those extreme temperatures, and hence why we're able to double the time on wing because of it.

### The Training Facility for Maintenance and Logistics

In this particular building, we have just about every modern Rolls-Royce jet engine that's on fleets around the world right now. They're all what they call dead engines. They're not being used anymore; they're not serviceable; they're not fit to fly. But what they do here is they work with customers, partners to bring them in and look at every aspect of how to work on, maintain, service these engines while they're out there flying around in the fleets of the world to make sure they have all those parts, all those practices down to do them properly. Including over in the corner there, an XWB engine, which they use to show how to disassemble it for transport because the whole thing in one piece cannot fit on a 747 freighter. So super cool to be able to see all these Rolls-Royce engines in one room.

### Advanced Boroscope Technology for Standardized Engine Inspection

**Presenter:** Paul Flint, Chief of Capability Programs (Rolls-Royce)

So what you're going to see here is a boroscope inspection. So we're interested in looking at the maintenance of engines, how we can use that maintenance data to inform our wider fleet management and fleet health activity. We want to standardise the task. So ideally, this is a Rolls-Royce solution, but the boroscope technology, which is Waygate Technologies, is actually industry-wide applicable. So an airline could take the boroscope kit, hardware, and then use that on non-Rolls-Royce products as well. So if we can get standardisation across the industry, it helps the people doing the inspection because they're only using one set of kit, helping the inspection be carried out more efficiently, more accurately, better quality, which obviously all leads to safety and reliability. But then the generation of that data, created in the standard way, and moved through to cloud in Rolls-Royce, which then gives you lots of opportunities around how you process that data using image processing and future AI development as well.

The engine we're going to be inspecting today, it's part of our Intelligent Boroscope Method programme. The Trent 1000, the Trent 7000 engines are the lead engines for that programme. The method can be applied to all Trent engines, but that's our lead programme. This is a Trent 7000 engine. What you're looking at in the middle of the engine is the core engine. The high-pressure system is kind of in the middle here. To carry out an inspection on this system, what we're interested in is... so there'll be periodic inspection of the high-pressure system, so looking at high-pressure turbine blades, physical condition of high-pressure turbine blades. So the aircraft maintenance manual will require you periodically to go in, carry out a physical inspection. The physical inspection process... obviously the hardware is right in the middle of the engine, so you have to get into the engine to get to the hardware. And to do that we use boroscope equipment.

### Boroscope Navigation and Probe Articulation

Boroscope equipment is the Waygate Technologies Mentor Visual IQ Plus, which is the latest and greatest boroscope technology. It does quite a few novel things. Access through a fairly small port, which is on the side of the engine. Is that the open port? So the borescope has a long lead and a camera on the end of the lead. So effectively you are able to, and this lead is, you can articulate this lead, so this lead has wires in it. So effectively there are motors in the borescope that will pull the wires. We are about to show you this actually. This is a 6.1mm probe with a side-facing tip. I'll keep the light away from the camera to try and... So we can use that by going into the engine and directing it. So if you are not on a straightforward part where the engine is accessible, you can navigate that through the different stages to get some... So it's kind of making that look easy, but when you are trying to feed in the probe, you are not entirely sure which way you might be facing. So there are lots of degrees of freedom when you are manipulating that probe to try and get to a certain location. He's made that look very easy, but that is actually quite hard. So there are other technology programs that at the moment we are working on that might help you get there, whether that's robotics or whether that's automated feed systems. Because actually it can be quite difficult to get to a location in a controlled way.

### 3D Scanning Technology in the Probe Tip

So the borescope tip that you can see there is a 6mm borescope tip. So you can see the light. So it's got a light when you go to the engine, because obviously you need to be able to see what you are looking at. It also has a built-in 3D projector. So it projects a grid of structured light onto the component that you are looking at, which effectively enables you to get a 3D scan of the component. So there is some really amazing technology in the tip of that probe, which has been miniaturized. So we have got a camera, a 3D scanner effectively, and a light source all on the end of this articulating control. And that's what makes this borescope technology more unique, that you are able to do this 3D scan.

### Inspection Procedures and Cloud-Based Metadata

So now we are in the engine. We have articulated the probe. Craig is operating to control this to a fixed view. So we have now published some fixed views for the AMM, Aircraft Maintenance Manual. So we now have a fixed procedure for the operator to follow. So the operator will now put in some metadata. So it's really important that we target the data by physical engine, physical inspection date, operator of the engine, with the visual data. So that when we move all of this data back to the cloud, then we will have all of the associated metadata. So then we can start doing the bigger data analysis. The airline also needs that for their audit trail, for when they have done the inspection. So if they are using a cloud-based platform to store all of this data, then they have a structure of who did the inspection, when it was done, whether it was a pass or a fail. It's all stored in the cloud.

### Menu-Directed Inspection and Standardization

Right. So this is a process called Menu-Directed Inspection. So basically we've published, so through their app store on the borescope, through Waygate's app store, we've published an inspection procedure, which is a structured inspection procedure. So it takes you to the engine type, the location, and gives you the specific, there you go. It gives you the specific guidelines that you need to work to, to establish and capture the data. So historically, you might have taken an image as an inspector, without recording any data, but maybe just said pass or fail. What we are moving to now is standardized inspections, data-rich inspections. So every customer uses the same workflow, every customer uses the same method, and every customer captures the data with the metadata, and the data gets communicated back to the cloud. At that point, you have the power of that data. But it also improves the inspection process because standardization is good from a human factors perspective.

### Automated Engine Turning for Blade Inspection

The second part of the system is the automated turning method. To inspect the turbine blades, we need to turn the core of the engine. Traditionally, during that, we would need a mechanic on the turning tool there, and you would have to manually turn the engine in a way that allows you to get every blade standardized in the frame, and then you do your inspection. The turning tool is connected to the borescope, so the two things communicate with each other. So now we can automate the turning to position the blades standardized in the frame every time, and then trigger the capture process to take the image. So that would start the engine turning automatically or relieve the load of manual turning for the mechanic.

### 3D Measurement and System Integration

So what you see there, when I said there was a 3D scan, so it takes an image, it takes a 3D scan, and it combines the image and the 3D scan together to give you a full 3D representation, but it can only see what line of sight it can achieve. So where there are shadows, that's where it cannot provide the data. So what you are seeing now is the process of measurement. We have a 3D scan, an image, and then the operator can put points on it and get measurements or assess areas. So the interesting thing about this technology is that the 3D data and the image are combined. So if I send this data to the cloud, so if I am an expert in Singapore, I can provide the physical measurement on the cloud in Derby for the inspection that is happening in Singapore. So once we get the system fully integrated, we will see a standard method, standard data, 3D data integrated, moving well to the cloud because the borescope is connected to Wi-Fi so it can move data. And then we can integrate all that data into our engine health monitoring systems. So we can do automated processing, accountability, and then we will start going into the AI and image processing world where you can automate those methods.

### Data Ecosystem and Impact on Future Designs

So we can look at how engines deteriorate in different environments. So if you have sandy environments or harsh environments, how an operator could use the engine from a thrust perspective or from a climb perspective. So it's connected with all the other data about the movement of aircraft around the world, the length of the routes they can operate, the passengers they can have on board, maybe you want to integrate weather data into that. The health monitoring system has pressures, temperatures, and speeds, which get communicated back to the cloud. So you start building this big ecosystem of data, including all of the different parameters of the design in terms of how those engines work and the variation, which leads to much more planning efficiency and customer experience. And obviously also when you think about future designs. Future designs. So all this data in the cloud is used for future designs. So maybe it affects current products by changing the design, changing the interval of the maintenance, because when you go into the very important times of where variations differ, you can develop things like lifing and then maybe you go into bigger architectural changes in terms of the engine if you feel that is useful in terms of the service data. So yes, that's the biggest long-term value that gets into future designs, so that future designs work more and more efficiently.
